                Stone was born on March 13, 1987, in Chewelah, Washington, near Spokane. He began his career singing at his fatherâ€™s church. His father was a preacher and his mother was an OB/GYN nurse. He began singing in church at the age of 3. By 14, Stone was leading worship at his church and playing the guitar. The draw of music for Allen was mainly being able to express himself to a crowd of people.
                He has released four records, Last to Speak (2010, self-released), the self-titled Allen Stone (2011, ATO Records), Radius (2015, Capitol Records), and Building Balance (2019, ATO Records). Radius was also re-released by ATO Records in 2016 as a deluxe edition with seven additional tracks.
